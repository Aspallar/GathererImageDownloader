This code is not mine. It was given to the admin of [Magic Duels Wiki](http://magicduels.wikia.com) by a chap called [Becer](http://magicduels.wikia.com/wiki/User:Becer) as a utility to help maintain the site.

I've volunteered to fix an outstanding issue with it and need a repository so have placed it here.
